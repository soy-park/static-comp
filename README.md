# Static Comp

## Abstract: 
I used HTML and CSS to create a static site based on a static comp outlined in https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html. My webpage mimics the general layout of the comp while displaying my own creativity with styling. I have chosen each box to represent a category in the medical field, and mentions the article that the author wrote in the specific category. The site can be viewed at https://soy-park.github.io/static-medical-comp/

## Context:
